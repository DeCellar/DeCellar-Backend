# NFTPub Backend API

### Introduction

Welcome to the Backend API for the NFT Wine Trading Platform. Our API is designed to support the creation, management and trading of NFTs representing wines. Our API makes use of the Polygon Network to ensure secure and fast transactions.

### Getting Started

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```
### Request & Response Format

Our API uses JSON as the request and response format. When making a request, make sure to set the Content-Type header to application/json. The response will also be in JSON format.

### Error Handling

In case of any errors, our API will return a 400 or 500 HTTP status code along with an error message. It is important to handle these errors in your code and show appropriate messages to the user.
